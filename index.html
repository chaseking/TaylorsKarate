                            in the martial arts. This vast experience was key in the establishment of Taylor's
                            House of Karate. His skills in Tae Kwon Do and Karate afforded him the opportunity
                            to train the teachers at the school, many of whom have won multiple championships
                            and all are well respected in the community. His contributions to the training programs,
                            fitness classes, testing formats and atmosphere of hard work, respect and discipline
                            is felt on daily basis.

                            to the successful establishment of the school is unmeasurable.

                            Team Proper has the notable distinction of having two members of the Bentley family
                            competing on the team. Nicole Bentley is the elder of the two and is currently ranked
                            number one in the nation in her division. In fact, it's not uncommon to see both Nicole
                            and her brother, Derek, vying against each other on stage for Forms Grand Champion.
                            Talk about a sibling rivalry.

                    <p>
                        Master Daythan Taylor is a Sixth Degree Black Belt, with over 39 years experience
                        in the martial arts. This vast experience was key in the establishment of Taylor's
                        House of Karate. His skills in Tae Kwon Do and Karate afforded him the opportunity
                        to train the teachers at the school, many of whom have won multiple championships
                        and all are well respected in the community. His contributions to the training programs,
                        fitness classes, testing formats and atmosphere of hard work, respect and discipline
                        is felt on daily basis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Steve Willey, owner of Taylor's House of Karate, says that Daythan Taylor's contributions
                        to the successful establishment of the school is unmeasurable.

                        he earned his second degree black belt and in 2006, his third degree. As a teenager,

                        Kyle is a Marin County native, started martial arts in the fall of 1996. He earned his
                        first degree black belt in April 2000 at West America Tae Kwon Do. He was an instructor
                        at West America from July 1999 until September 2002. During that time he competed in Forms
                        and Sparring. He is a two time AAU California State Champion in forms and sparring, 1999
                        and 2000. In 2000 became AAU National Champion in forms and Fighting. From September 2001 to

                        Karate after many conversations with a friend and Taylor's House of Karate instructor, Derek

                    <p>
                        Team Proper has the notable distinction of having two members of the Bentley family
                        competing on the team. Nicole Bentley is the elder of the two and is currently ranked
                        number one in the nation in her division. In fact, it's not uncommon to see both Nicole
                        and her brother, Derek, vying against each other on stage for Forms Grand Champion.
                        Talk about a sibling rivalry.

                    <p>
                        Nicole began martial arts in 1999, at the age of 19. She earned her 1st degree Black Belt
                        in 2006 and received her 2nd degree three years later.
